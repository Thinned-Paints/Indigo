# Indigo
C++ powered chatbot. Some assembly required.

It's coding practice for learning C++, and some MongoDB aswell, for the data storage.
Since you can request a copy of all of your facebook messages in a handy dandy JSON format, I figured it'd be a neat way of custom tailoring a chatbot to you.


Since this is coding practice, it's going to take time as I don't currently know C++ very well, so I'll be learning as I go.
